        <p>
          Today, we took the opportunity to share our knowledge with our peers
          about the wonders of Flask. We covered the basics of building a web
          application using Flask, from setting up a new project to creating
          routes and templates.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also delved into more advanced topics, such as using databases and
          creating APIs. Our peers were engaged and asked thoughtful questions,
          making it a great learning experience for everyone involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          We explored the benefits of using Flask, including its lightweight and
          flexible nature, making it an ideal choice for building web
          applications. We also discussed the importance of security and best
          practices when building a Flask application.
        </p>
        <p>
          The session was interactive, with hands-on exercises and live coding
          demonstrations. Our peers were able to get a feel for how Flask works
          and were able to ask questions and clarify any doubts they had.
